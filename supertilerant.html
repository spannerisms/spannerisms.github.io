title: Supertiles Is Not Good
---
<div class="contentstuff">
	<h1>Ranting about a word</h1>
	<p>"Supertile" is a bad name, and it always has been.</p>

	<p>First and foremost is the fact that we're overloading terminology when we don't need to. The term "tile" already means several things&mdash;an enemy, a unit of area, a unit of graphics&mdash;and now it means another, but on top of that, we're not even using our prefixes correctly. The prefix <i>super-</i> means "above". A tile is <span class="snark" title="Or 16-by-16 pixels, if you're wrong.">8-by-8 pixels</span>, and sure, a supertile is bigger than a tile. A lot bigger. But then there are "subtiles".</p>

	<p>The prefix <i>sub-</i> means "below". So, based on our terminology, our hierarchy is, from largest to smallest: supertile, subtile, tile. With a name like "subtile", you should expect it to be <em>smaller</em> than a tile, but it's not. It's a lot bigger. </p>

	<p>Now, you're probably thinking, <em>"No no no&mdash;'tile' refers to something else. It's not those tiles!!!"</em></p>
	<p>Okay, then what are <em>these</em> "tiles"? The hierarchy still has nothing between "super" and "sub". The names still imply that there exists something called a tile below supertiles and above subtiles (since, ya know, the prefixes are on the word "tile"). But what you'll actually find is that below the supertile is the subtile; above, vice versa. One of these prefixes is both wrong and redundant (a nasty combination); however, if we change one of the terms simply "tile", we come back to the problem that this already refers to something else commonly discussed.</p>

	<p>Obviously, this is an important concept. Definitely important enough to need a name. So what do I prefer? I think we should just call supertiles "rooms". The only real argument against this is that, in the real world, rooms are defined by how the walls divide the space. In theory, what I am proposing we call a "room" could have any number of what would be considered a "room" in the real world! (though, in practice, the most seen is 4) But I think this just does not matter. I am not looking for a definition that precisely matches the real world. I just want a rigorous one.</p>

	<p>If we use the name "room", our transition names just change to "inter-room" and "intra-room" transition. With <i>inter-</i> meaning "between" and <i>intra-</i> meaning "within", these names will come with the added benefit of being more precise.</p>

	<p>What we call rooms is less important than just not calling them "supertiles", and there are plenty of better alternatives:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rooms and subrooms</li>
		<li>Rooms and chambers</li>
		<li>Rooms and quadrants</li>
		<li>Superrooms and rooms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any of those would be infinitely better. The root of our current terminology is grossly overloaded, and we're not even using the rest of the word correctly.</p>
