	<h1><i>The Gauntlet</i></h1>

	<p>Deep below the mantle of Hyrule lies a wicked dungeon known as the Cubicles of Futaba. The curse of this place is such that its chambers are unnavigably random. After 5612 years, the malison within has begun seeping out onto the surface world. Your only chance at survival is fighting your way through as many floors as you can and hoping it works out.</p>

	<p>Unlike standard Legend of Zelda games and hacks thereof, <i>The Gauntlet</i> has no fixed dungeons. Each room is random, as are the enemies and items within. Your plunge begins with only the fighter sword, but you will find more equipment as you progress. At the same time, the number and strength of the enemies you face will increase as you fight your way deeper.</p>

	<p>Your crawl ends when you die or reach the final room, after which, you may begin a new game that will be completely different from the last.</p>

	<h2>Download</h2>
	<p>This hack is currently in public beta. It may be downloaded by <a href="/assets/gauntlet.bps">clicking here</a>. The patch should be applied over a JP1.0 ROM file.</p>

	<h2>Options</h2>
	<p>The standard file select screen is replaced with an options screen where you can customize the nature of your next attempt.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Difficulty</b> - how difficult the game is and how quickly it ramps up</li>
		<li><b>Floor count</b> - how many cubicles must be cleared before the game is completed</li>
		<li><b>Events</b> - choose whether boss fights and merchant rooms can appear between regular cubicles</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Details of note</h2>
	<p>Some things had to be changed to improve the general experience of the game, but these are mostly minor.</p>

	<h3>Sprites</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Blobs, geldmen, and stalfos knights no longer fully conceal themselves.</li>
		<li>Some enemies will exit their dormancy sooner than they normally would.</li>
		<li>More enemies can walk on shallow water. Oh, and beware of hydroplaning!</li>
		<li>Some enemies are clamped to stay within the room's boundaries.</li>
		<li>Blue antifaeries are never required to clear a room. A red antifaerie always is.</li>
		<li>Keese are required to clear a room.</li>
		<li>Stunned enemies no longer drop a green rupee.</li>
		<li>The message prompts for catching bees and faeries have been replaced with sound effects.</li>

		<li>Agahnim never fires blue balls, but he always has access to lightning.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Items</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Potion refills are rendered as cauldrons.</li>
		<li>Bee and fairy refills are rendered as the respective entity.</li>
		<li>Some cubicles contain difficult-to-reach chests before every enemy is defeated. These are bonus chests that contain nice and sometimes rare items; but, they will never hold an item considered progression.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>New items</h3>
