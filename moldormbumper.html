	<h1>Moldorm 2 Bumper Bounce</h1>
	<p>Have you ever hovered Moldorm 2? Or have you ever seen someone hover Moldorm 2? If so, did you think it would be absolutely <em>hilarious</em> to call them a "cheater"? If you have said that, please leave.</p>
	<p>Something you may have noticed happens sometimes is a violent reaction from one bumper in the next room. Perhaps it's applauding you for saving 6 seconds. Or perhaps it's so delighted with itself for the cleverness of calling you a "cheater" that it can't stop laughing. Neither of these is the case. Unfortunately and fortunately, respectively.</p>

	<h2>Boing, as it were</h2>
	<p>One misguided explanation of this glitch is some garbage about Moldorm's head's bouncing being transferred over to the bumper and that somehow does something. Funnily enough, this is like that old adage "A broken clock is always right twice a day." Except in this case, the clock says it's 5:01<span class="timeampm">pm</span> when it's really 3:09 <span class="timeampm">am</span>. I mean, hey, they got the middle number right! There's only a 1/6 chance of that happening!</p>
	<p>There's a key thing that bumpers do that Moldorm doesn't: bounce other sprites. When bumpers can bounce a sprite is pretty straightforward, but I noticed something funny, and also I want this page to be longer.</p>

	<p>We'll go through this lines one-by-one, and it will all make sense in the end.</p>
<code class="snesasm">
		TYA : EOR $1A : AND #$03
		ORA $0F70, Y : BNE .no_sprite_collision
		LDA $0DD0, Y : CMP #$09 : BCC .no_sprite_collision
		LDA $0E60, Y : ORA $0F60, Y : AND #$40 : BNE .no_sprite_collision
</code>

	<h3>Frame rules</h3>
	<p>Ahhh, frame rules. Bumper-to-sprite interactions are no exception, and they use the standard collision frame rule. Take the sprite slot of the sprite in question and exclusive-OR it with the frame counter. Finally, look at the bottom 2 bits. If they're both 0, then the collision check proceeds. But this has an efficient twist.</p>

	<h3>Altitude</h3>
	<p>Oh altitude, you've become as famous as frame rules in the past couple of years. Bumpers only want to hit sprites flat on the ground. To do this, they take the previous frame rule value and OR in the bits of the sprite height. If those together are nonzero, then the collision check is skipped. This is the same result as checking each separately, but it's more efficient, both space- and cycle-wise. I'm a little surprised.</p>

	<h3>State</h3>
	<p>The next check is the sprite's state. This value is compared to <code class="value">$9</code>, which is the value for sprites which are active and running their full AI. The check uses the operation <code class="opcode">BCC</code>, which, when used with the preceding <code class="opcode">CMP</code>, doubles as a "greater than or equal". So this check also works for sprites in sprite states <code class="value">$A</code> (being carried by player) and <code class="value">$B</code> (frozen or stunned)</code>. All other sprite states&mdash;dead, dying, falling, exploding&mdash;fail, and will result in the collision check being skipped.</p>

	<h3>Invulnerability and Statis</h3>
	<p>Now we're at the stuff that actually matters. These 2 are lumped together in the code, and because invulnerability is straight forward, I've decided to lump them together here. How straightforward is invulnerability? If bit 6 of <code class="address">$0E60,Y</code> is on, then the sprite can't be hurt.</p>
	<p>Statis is pretty straight forward as well, but it was a given a funky name in the disassembly, so it's 100x more confuing. If bit 6 of <code class="address">$0F60,Y</code> is 1, then the sprite will not count towards kill rooms. So enemies like anti-faeries, and for some reason keese, and non-enemy sprites like bumpers and statues will have this bit set. This will allow shutter doors to open or chests to appear when the condition is "kill everyone" but they're still on screen.</p>
	<p>These two properties occupy the same bit of separate addresses, so they can be safely ORed together before the check instead of looking at them separately. Anothing surprising win for the vanilla devs.</p>
	<p>Bumpers have the statis bit set, but not invulnerability. The latter doesn't matter because they don't even run routines that check for damage from the player, so they're already hardcoded to be invulnerable.</p>

	<h3>Something funny</h3>
	<p>What you may not have noticed but I definitely did, was that there's no mention of the layer any sprite is on. This would imply that bumpers can hit sprites on other layers. Sure enough, if I edit a bumper's memory to be on the lower layer, it still bounces sprites that land inside its hitbox.</p>

	<h3>Something important</h3>
	<p>Another oddity that will be important to remember is that all of these initial checks are executor-agnostic. Only the sprite to be bounced is looked at; who does the bouncing seems irrelevant.</p>

	<h2>:Oooox</h2>
	<p>You now know everything there is to know about bumpers for this glitch. But it doesn't explain the bouncing. Clearly, something is odd about Moldorm. There are a lot of things odd about Moldorm, but we only need to look at one thing (with some rubbernecking along the way)</p>

	<h3>Hitboxes</h3>
	<p>Moldorm has 2 hitboxes. This should come as no surprise to anyone, but it is a little unorthodox. Moldorm consists of a single sprite, and sprite's are only one assigned one hitbox. So how does the second hitbox work? Which one even is the second hitbox.</p>
	<p>It's the tail. Moldorm's main hitbox is his head. The specific thing about Moldorm that we need to look at is his segmentation. Each segment needs to operate somewhat independently, but also dependently. Moldorm uses subroutines. Wait really? Shut up and let me finish.</p>
	<p>Moldorm uses subroutines to operate each segment of his body. This occurs in the draw routine, which makes sense. Most of Moldorm's body does nothing except exist. They need to move with the body in a choo-choo train fashion, but that's it. The tail is different.</p>

	<h3>x</h3>
	<p>Moldorm's tail is the only part that can be damaged, and it accomplishes this in an inelaborate way. The first thing to do after drawing is set the address <code class="address">$0D90,X</code> to 1. Next is to completely zero out the addresses <code class="address">$0F60,X</code> and <code class="address">$0CAA,X</code>. These are addresses for hitbox and deflection properties, respectively. Clearing the deflection properties makes some sense, assuming we want them all 0. And hitbox 0 happens to be the one we want for the tail, but these addresses contain other properties&hellip; I guess they'll fix it later?</p>
	<p>After that, Moldorm's coordinates (which represent his head) are pushed to the stack, and new values (of the tail) are written to his coordinate addresses. The standard damage from player check is run with those values. The 1 into <code class="address">$0D90,X</code> from earlier is to tell that routine to not apply a knockback to Link. After the routine, it is set back to 0.<p>
	<p>Oh, here's where they fixed those reckless zeros. <code class="address">$0F60,X</code> is set to <code class="value">#$09</code> and <code class="address">$0CAA,X</code> to <code class="value">#$04</code>. This is where I must point out a weird oversight. <code class="value">#$04</code> is not the value Moldorm spawns with. He actually spawns with <code class="value">#$81</code>, which means he will stay active off-screen (bit 7) and won't be killed manually under certain conditions (bit 0). So why is it set to <code class="value">#$04</code>? All that bit does is make moldorm immune to sword and hammer. Does this mean that without the tail, Moldorm is vulnerable to sword attacks? No. Even without that property, other aspects of the check leave Moldorm impervious. It does, however, mean that Moldorm is prevented from being active off screen.</p>
	<p>As far as the ROM data is concerned, Moldorm should be active, even when off-screen, but the tail, as soon as it's allowed to run its code, decides to change that. You can sort of see this. If Link's coordinates are offset from where they should be (such as with the jingle glitch), you might notice that Moldorm's sound effect plays, with Moldorm nowhere in sight. The only problem I noticed when I changed the code to restore <code class="value">#$81</code> was a very rare teleporting tail graphic. Perhaps this is the reason they added that? Who knows?</p>

	<h2>Transitions</h2>
	<p>This is the last piece of the puzzle to tie everything together. When you transition, sprites from both the new room and the old room are visible on screen. A routine is run every frame to cache a bunch of data for every sprite and put old sprite data in there for a second run. 24 different properties are cached, but for some reason, <code class="address">$0F60,X</code> isn't one of them. Neither is <code class="address">$0CAA,X</code>, but that doesn't matter.<p>
	<p>While all these other values end up being cached and restored, the one for statis and hitbox is not. By sheer coincidence, hitboxes <code class="value">#$09</code> and <code class="value">#$1A</code> (the one bumpers should have) are exactly the same! Wait&hellip; What? Every other hitbox is at least subtly different, and&hellip; Hold on. Bumpers are the only sprite with hitbox <code class="value">#$1A</code>. Why didn't you just reuse <code class="value">#$09</code>? What a waste.</p>
	<p>Okay, so the hitboxes stay the same, but statis doesn't. Moldorm counts for kill rooms, and this property is forced onto the bumper, because the original value is never saved.</p>

	<h2>Stop hitting yourself</h2>
	<p>Literally. The bumper is just hitting itself. With statis off, every other check is passed. Obviously, the bumper's hitbox overlaps with itself. Thus, every 4 frames, the bumper just bounces itself. It stays in place because, with its coordinates perfectly matching themselves, the recoil velocity on both axes is 0. Hilariously, the redundant invulnerability bit would have prevented the bouncing altogether (that address is indeed cached), and no one would know of this glitch. It would be too subtle; everything else appears completely normal.</p>

	<h2>What if we go up?</h2>
	<p>This glitch isn't specific to bumpers. Those properties of Moldorm will transfer to any slot 0 sprite during the transition. So what happens to the room above? In that room, the north-west crystal switch happens to be in slot 0. And it's super easy to do this glitch. So easy that I'm surprised it's never been notice here. During the transition into Moldorm 2, just hold up. Voila! The crystal switch now has some weird properties.</p>
	<p>If you try to walk onto it, it seems normal, but compare it to the other crystal switch. Walking into the other one will let you go a few pixels in, but this glitchy one stops you fairly early. It can even seem like you're stuck on nothing if you align yourself pefectly with the orange pegs and try to pass vertically.</p>
	<p>Now try slashing it. You can't. The switch will clink but not change color, and you'll recoil a little.</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>A specific property is the only thing preventing bumpers from hitting themselves. During transitions, most properties of sprites are cached so that old and new can share the same addresses for execution. Hitboxes and that property (on the same address) are not cached. Moldorm's tail's hitbox is executed as part of a subroutine that also handles drawing, so it is executed during these transitions. This subroutine ends up changing the hitbox of the bumper on transitions where Moldorm is visible. Moldorm and bumpers have different hitboxes that happen to be exactly the same size and position, but the one property that prevented bumpers from interacting themselves was cleared.</p>

	<h2>Shortest summary</h2>
	<p>The bumper is literally hitting itself.</p>
