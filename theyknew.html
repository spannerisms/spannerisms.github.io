	<h1>They knew. Yes they did.</h1>
	<p>Just based on the way the game is coded, you can sort of tell if a glitch was known about. And not just because the glitch is fixed in later versions. Sometimes things happen on accident. Here's my opinion on some glitches the developers might have known about.</p>

	<h2>Fake flippers</h2>
	<strong class="verdict">Definitely</strong>
	<p>But only the transition method. The fix for fake flippers is pretty specific to transitioning. It doesn't work as well for the other methods, because they still actually work, they just don't let you move around in the water. If they did know about fairy revival, it was a really lazy fix, as you never get kicked out of the water.</p>

	<h2>Mirror block erase</h2>
	<strong class="verdict">Probable</strong>
	<p>While the glitch is fixed after JP1.0, I'm can't say they definitely knew, because the fix is just a change that made sense. The best case scenario is they knew about the glitch. Worst case is they knew the mirror code would cause a problem, but they weren't sure what.</p>

	<h2>Spinspeed/Item dashing</h2>
	<strong class="verdict">1 but not the other</strong>
	<p>Unsurprisngly, both of these glitches are fixed by the same line of code, which does an extra check for dash state. Spinspeed is not an intuitive glitch to come up with. Item dashing is pretty easy. Just press 2 buttons at the same time, anyone can think of that. I think the most likely case is they knew about item dashing but <em>not</em> spinspeed. The jury's out on if they knew about using hookdashes for superspeed.</p>
