	<h1>Glitch Explications</h1>
	<p>Welcome to <em class="thispage">Glitch Explication</em>, my personal lecture hall to explain glitches in as much excruciatingly pointless detail as I'd like. <em>And no one can stop me.</em> My goal is both to teach and to learn, and maybe provide a little bit of humor. In these posts, I plan to strip games (mostly <i class="gameName">A Link to the Past</i>) down to their individual CPU operations in an attempt to pinpoint the what, where, why, and how of these bugs. I want these to be accessible, so I will mostly aim to use terminology that anyone familiar enough with the game should understand. Where I can't help but get technical, I'll either explain what I'm talking about or add a new term to one of my <a href="glossaries">glossaries</a>.</p>
