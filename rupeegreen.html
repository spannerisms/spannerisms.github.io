	<h1><i class="gameName">The Legend of Zelda: Rupee Green</i></h1>
	<p><i class="gameName">Rupee Green</i> is a hack I'm currently working on that will retell the boilerplate <i class="gameName">Pokémon</i> story through the Zelda 3 engine.</p>
	<p>For the hack, I plan all of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Completely custom story and region, with new personalities and flavor.</li>
		<li>Custom enemy sprites and AI, modeled after pokémon from the first 5 generations.</li>
		<li>Custom arrangements for every music track, bringing songs from a variety of <i class="gameName">Pokémon</i> games to the SPC.</li>
		<li>Partner pokémon that follow you for the entire game.</li>
		<li>8 gyms and various side dungeons to replace the crystal and pendant dungeons.</li>
		<li>Revamped tree-pull system that becomes more rewarding as you progress through the game.</li>
		<li>Post-game content that gives you something to do after becoming champion.</li>
		<li>Collectible items to reward exploration.</li>
		<li>Improved damage system that allows more dynamic values.</li>
		<li>Custom spawn system. Spawn at your house or at the last Pokémon Center visited.</li>
		<li>Wild encounters, both on the overworld and natural dungeons.</li>
		<li>Stats screen that tracks content to create a percentage counter.</li>
		<li>Improved text system that include character names. It also defaults to writing 1 character per frame that makes reading easier.</li>
		<li>General engine improvements that reduce lag, especially for loading.</li>
		<li>Status ailments that enemies can apply to the player as a hindrance.</li>
		<li>Various graphical changes to give the game a more pokémon feel.</li>
		<li>Easter eggs, including: hints, jokes, and developer insight.</li>
		<li>The mirror works in all dungeons all caves.</li>
		<li>Bug unfixes that allow itemdashing and spinspeed to work on the US ROM.</li>
	</ul>
