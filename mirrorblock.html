	<h1>Mirror Block Erase</h1>
	<p>Erasing pushable blocks with the mirror is something everyone knows how to do. Just use the mirror while the block is moving, and <span class="poof">POOF!</span> the block is gone. I don't think I've ever seen an earnest attempt to explain why it happens; everyone just accepted that it does. Well, gang, the mystery is now solved. And the explanation is super simple, to boot.</p>

	<h2>Blocks</h2>
	<p>Let's start by understanding how pushable blocks move in the first place. Only 2 blocks are meant to do anything at any one time. To handle this, two addresses (<code class="address">$05FC</code> and <code class="address">$05FD</code>) hold the index+1 of the currently active blocks&mdash;more on this weird indexing later. A value of <code class="value">0</code> means that slot is not active. If blocks can't find a free slot to use, they simply won't get pushed.</p>

	<p>Now let's look at the routine that is executed every frame in normal dungeon mode:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The address <code class="address">$042C</code> is reset and then the routine <code class="routine">PushBlock_Handler</code> is executed. This address is used as an index counter for the following loop.</li>
		<li class="branchpoint" id="loopstart">The value of <code class="address">$042C</code> is loaded into <code class="register">Y</code>. It is compared to the value at address <code class="address">$0428</code>. If they are not equal, then the state of the block at that index is checked, otherwise, the routine exits.</li>
		<li>The desired block's state is read by using <code class="register">Y</code> to index the array at <code class="address">$0500</code>.
			<ul>
				<li>If the block's state is <code class="value">0</code>, then it is inactive, and the <a class="branch" href="#nextblock">the next block is looked at</a>.</li>
				<li>If the block's state is <code class="value">1</code>, then it is erased from the tile and collision maps. Its state is incremented by 1, and <a class="branch" href="#nextblock">the next block is looked at.</a></li>
				<li>
						<p>If the block's state is <code class="value">2</code>, then its movement code is executed. After the movement code is executed, the block's state is checked again.</p>
						<p>If it is <code class="value">3</code>, the block's state is quickly incremented to <code class="value">4</code>. This check for state <code class="value">3</code> is inside the state <code class="value">2</code> branch, so it will only ever be checked from there. This state appears to be an indication that the block is over a pit.</p>
						<p>If the block has finished moving without reaching <code class="value">3</code>, it resets its state <code class="value">0</code>.</p>
					</li>
				<li>If the block's state is <code class="value">4</code>, then it is falling, and that animation is performed. When the animation is finished, the block is reset to state <code class="value">0</code>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li class="branchpoint" id="nextblock">Address <code class="address">$042C</code> is incremented twice, then <a class="branch" href="#loopstart">the loop is started again</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>State <code class="value">2</code> is where the problem occurs in most cases, so that's the branch we'll focus on. But actually, you can mirror erase a block that's newly pushed (state <code class="value">1</code>) or falling (state <code class="value">4</code>). The reason will end up being the same.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>State <code class="value">2</code> begins by calling a routine that doesn't have a name in the disassembly, but it's <code class="address">$3EDB5</code> in the US ROM file, so let's call this routine <code class="routine">Bingo</code>, because it ends with B5.</li>
		<li><code class="routine">Bingo</code> goes like this:
			<ol>
				<li>Check the current submodule. If it isn't <code class="value">0</code>, exit the routine.</li>
				<li>Cache the value of <code class="register">Y</code> in scratch space.</li>
				<li>Set <code class="register">X</code> to <code class="value">1</code> and use <code class="register">X</code> to index address <code class="address">$05FC</code>, loading that value into <code class="register">A</code>.</li>
				<li>Decrement <code class="register">A</code> by 1&mdash;I promise I'll get to it&mdash;, multiply it by 2, then compare it to the cached value of <code class="register">Y</code>.
					<ul>
						<li>If <code class="register">A</code> and <code class="register">Y</code> are equal, then leave <code class="register">X</code> at <code class="value">1</code> and continue.</li>
						<li>If they don't match, set <code class="register">X</code> to <code class="value">0</code> before continuing.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Multiply <code class="register">X</code> by 2 and give it to <code class="register">Y</code>.</li>
				<li>Do moving and stuff.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Continue the movement routine using <code class="register">Y</code> as the index for the block's data.</li>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Hold the phone. What?</p>
	<p>Why are you using <code class="register">X</code> to index an address outside of a loop, right after you've loaded a constant into <code class="register">X</code>? That will never <em>not</em> be <code class="address">$05FD</code>.</p>
	<p>Why are you loading <code class="value">0</code> into <code class="register">X</code> and just rolling with it? I think what you meant to do was branch backwards and run that indexed address check again.</p>
	<p>These are questions that people want answered. At least I do!</p>
	<p>The reason active block indices are stored as index+1 is so that 0 can act as an indicator that means the slot is empty. The reason the value is doubled is because that value indexes bytes; the routine needs to index words, which are twice the size.</p>
	<p>Rolling with slot 0 allows the possibility of operating on an index of 0. What if a block is moving but doesn't have its index stored? Can you make that happen?</p>

	<h2>Amazing Mirror</h2>
	<p>You sure can!</p>
	<p>Only a few things reset those index addresses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Saving and quitting</li>
		<li>Blocks themselves, once they are finished doing their thang</li>
		<li>Using the mirror</li>
		<li>Dying</li>
		<li>Dying (it's there twice, okay?)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You get where I'm going with this already? Well, shut up and let me finish.</p>
	<p>The developers actually seemed to know that blocks resetting the indices themselves wouldn't be enough. They tried to cover all their bases by examining what could be done if a block is active. They covered most of it. Just me personally, but <em>I</em> would have <strong>made them reset whenever a new room is loaded</strong>. But I digress.</p>
	<p>I digress pretty often actually.</p>
	<p>The developers also made an itsy-bitsy mistake in JP1.0: they had the mirror clear the slots every time it is used. Later versions fixed this by moving those clears to be <em>inside</em> of the "successfully mirrored" branch.</p>
	<p>In a way, you're not actually deleting the block, you're just making it behave as if it's somewhere else. In fact, the block remains active after you mirror erase it. It will continue its routine forever, because there's no one telling it to stop. The values it's being told to use are all wrong, and it won't reach its expected destination anymore. It just chugs on, oblivious to the damnation cast upon it.</p>
	<p>Its index is no longer in the active block array, but it doesn't <em>need</em> to be. That's only used because the developers also wanted to keep the velocities and other values for moving blocks in a smaller portion of memory. A block runs code regardless when its state in the states array is nonzero. That array is not limited to only 2 blocks. The active index array only tells a block what data it should be using to do whatever it's doing. You can conclude that if multiple blocks have been mirror erased, then they're all messing with the same values. I bet things would look bonkers if we could actually see what was going on!</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>When blocks are pushed, the index of their data is put into a slot in a 2 item array. This slot is then used to update their coordinates and velocity. When the mirror is used, both values in that index array are set to 0, which is meant to indicate the slot is free. This happens in caves, but it doesn't affect the blocks' actual status; the blocks will keep running, but a coding mistake will have them assume that they should use the first value in the array as an index if the second value is not correct. This bad assumption results in 0, an invalid index, being used for the block's data.</p>
	<p>The block continues operating, and is not technically erased. This makes this glitch a form of misslotting, but a slightly different species from other known misslots. In versions after JP1.0, a check is performed to see if the beep sound effect was played, and doesn't reset the array if it was.</p>
